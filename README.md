## Getting Started

This section will guide you through setting up and running the project on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

  * **Python:** Make sure you have Python installed. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
  * **pip:** Python's package installer, which usually comes bundled with Python.

### Installation

1.  **Navigate to the project directory:**
    Open your command prompt or terminal and change to the directory where your `app.py` file is located.

    ```bash
    cd /path/to/your/app.py/directory
    ```

    *Replace `/path/to/your/app.py/directory` with the actual path to your project folder.*

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    Once you're in the correct directory, install the required Python packages using pip:

    ```bash
    pip install Flask Flask-Cors
    ```

    This command will download and install Flask (the web framework) and Flask-Cors (for handling Cross-Origin Resource Sharing).

### Running the Application

After installing the dependencies, you can start the Flask application:

```bash
python app.py
```

This will start the development server, and you'll typically see output in your terminal indicating that the server is running and on which address (e.g., `http://127.0.0.1:5000/`).
